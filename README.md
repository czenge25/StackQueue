# StackQueue

This is a java implementation of the Queue class that iterates through the queue using 2 stacks, one for enqueueing and one for dequeueing. The class has the methods size(for the size of the queue), isEmpty(true if the queue is empty, and false for not empty), dequeue(for removing elements from the queue), enqueue(for adding elements to the queue), and peek(for looking at the element at the back of the queue).
